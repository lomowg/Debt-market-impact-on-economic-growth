# Debt market impact on economic growth
The purpose of this research is to identify and analyse the relation between GDP dynamics and bond volumes in the Russian financial market and to assess the extent of this relation. I looked at data for several years and conducted an analysis that will allow me to understand how changes in the bond market can affect the economic growth and stability of a country.
The data used in the paper are:
* [Government Bond Market Volume - Russia](https://cbonds.ru/indexes/4695/)
* [Corporate Bond Market Size - Russia](https://cbonds.ru/indexes/58/)
* [Global Economy Indicators](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/global-economy-indicators)


This paper found that there is a moderate positive correlation between the volume of corporate and government bonds and Russia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).


# Tools
For the analysis I used the Python language and corresponding libraries:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
